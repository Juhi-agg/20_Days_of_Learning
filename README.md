<h3>Day 1:</h3>
Image recognisition has been in use lately. The very begining of the journey with DL using widely used MNIST Dataset. The brilliant youtube playlist created by Mr. Dhaval Patel, is really nice and crisp explaination of the concepts. <br>

<h3>Day 2:</h3>
Builing up on the previous model.

<h3>Day 3 & 4:</h3>
Forage is a revised platform of InsideSephera. It issues various problem statements and curated tasks from MNCs. I completed first two tasks which was regading the data enquiry and EDA. I iterated upon the Task2 after looking at the solution.

<h3>Day 5:</h3>
Having applied ML modeling before on Customer churn data, I decided to work with a ANN model on the same. I picked up a kaggle dataset of Telcom Customer Churn, cleaned the required bit and modelled it.
